## Studies on SVMs and MLPs
### Important Libraries
Following libraries must be installed on the system to run `notebook.ipynb`:
* `numpy` for mathematical operations
* `matplotlib` for plotting graphs
* `pandas` for handling dataset
* `sklearn` for SVM and MLP API


### Executing the code
* Open `notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
* Run the notebook. Plots will be generated for corresponding tables. It will take two minutes at maximum for the execution.
* It is recommended that you run the notebook on  `Google Colab` instead of your local machine.
